# wanikani-writing

A collection of printable writing pratice sheet for learning Japanese kanji. Organized by Wanikani levels. They are each available in two paper sizes (US letter, and a4) and with three character sizes -- large characters (4 per page), medium characters (6 per page) and small characters (8 per page).

In addition, this repository contains a linux bash script for generating pdf files of your own from csv files with $LaTeX.$ Sample csv files as well as other required scripts and documents are contained in the assets folder.

I'll be adding some documentation soon!
